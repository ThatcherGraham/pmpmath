<b>Q: Where can I get more information about Project Management ?</b><br>
A: I reccomend you go to <a href="http://www.pmi.org">pmi.org</a>. 
If you're serious, you should also consider joining your local PMP chapter. PMI.org can direct you to them.

<b>Q: What course of study/resources to you reccomend for passing the PMP?</b><br>
A: I found the test more difficult than my physics courses at college. 
The content of the test is not that difficult, but the format and method of testing makes passing extremely challenging.
I reccomend a disciplined course of self study with color-coded flash cards and reading the PMBOK cover to cover at least twice.
I also strongly reccomend you take a PMP preperation class. 
I attended a PMP training course at <a href="http://projectmanagementacademy.net/select-location.php">Project Management Academy</a>. I don't think I would have passed without it.

<b>Q: Will all pf this be on the PMP exam?</b><br>
A: No. The PMP exam mostly requires that you memorize the formulas and know when to use them. 
However, for some people like myself it is better to understand something than to memorize it. 
As a PM you will likely find the information here more appropriate to real-world applications.

<b>Q: How accurate are all of this information?</b><br>
A: That is complicated. Since the PMBOK does not include this information you can consider it extracirricular. 
They do not define all of the methology so much as collect and collate it. 
Hence the name of the text book is PMBOK: Project Management Body of Knowledge. 
The information here reflects my understanding which comes packed up with a PMP and a decade of experience. 
I also checked my answers with other friends and colleagues in the industry so they are as complete as possible. 
I plan to continue refining and correcting them over time.

<b>Q: I think you made a mistake/omission!</b><br>
A: Contact me through my home page <a href="http://www.thatchergraham.com">here</a> 
I don't like to be wrong, so I am happy to be corrected if that is the case.

<b>Q: How did you design this website?</b><br>
A: This website was designed in HTML5 from scratch in <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>. 
I wish someone would port Notepad++ to Linux so I could use it everywhere. Yes, this website is HTML5 compliant.
